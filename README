apgmera:  Runs random initial configurations in cellular automata and
          periodically uploads results to https://catagolue.appspot.com

Software prerequisites:  Bash, Python 2.x, GCC (g++ and make)
Hardware prerequisites:  any 64-bit machine with an x86 processor

Compile the program like so:

./recompile.sh

If compilation succeeded, the last two lines should read:

apgmera v3.2: Rule b3s23 is correctly configured.
apgmera v3.2: Symmetry C1 is correctly configured.

which means you are ready to run the program like so:

./apgmera [OPTIONS]

The options may include, for example:

-k mypassword                   Upload soups where 'mypassword' is your key*
-n 5000000                      Run 5000000 soups per upload
-p 4                            Parallelise across 4 threads
--rule b36s245                  Run the custom rule B36/S245
--symmetry D2_+1                Run soups with odd bilateral symmetry

* see https://catagolue.appspot.com/payosha256 for instructions on how to
  create a key; if left blank, results are uploaded anonymously.

For example, you might run:

./apgmera -k mypassword -p 4 -n 20000000

Important: compile apgmera on the same machine on which you intend to run it.
